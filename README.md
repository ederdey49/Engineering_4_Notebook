### Hello Raspberry Pi Zero
#### Objectives
For this assignment, we had to set up our Raspberry Pi and code it to make the Pi print "Hello World!" ten times- code found [here](https://github.com/lcrosby13/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Scripts/LED_Blink.sh).

#### Lessons Learned
During this assignment, we learned some basics in Bash and how the Pi terminal works, as well as how to set up the Pi and attach it to the monitor. 

### Dice Roller
#### Objectives
The objective of this assignment was to make a little program that, when the user presses enter, displays a random number between 1 and 6, like a dice roll. Code found [here](https://github.com/lcrosby13/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/DiceRoller.py).

#### Lessons Learned
From this assignment, we learned some basics of how Python works, because in previous years we'd coded in C, and if you've taken AP Computer Science (like me), then you learn Java, so Python is new. 

### Calculator
#### Objectives
The objective of this assignment was to get the pi to run 5 operations on numbers input by the user- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo- and then return all of those results. Code found [here](https://github.com/lcrosby13/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Calculator.py).

#### Lessons Learned
We learned more about how Python works, and more specifically about how functions work in Python, as well as the types of variables. 

### Quadratic Solver
#### Objectives
The objective of this assignment was to solve for the roots of a quadratic function filled in by the user. The difficulty comes from the fact that the program has to first figure out how many roots the quadratic has. Code is [here](https://github.com/lcrosby13/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/QuadSolver.py).

#### Lessons Learned
We learned more about Python and how variables work in Python.
