# Engineering 4 Notebook
by Ned and Lucia

## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero
### Objectives
For this assignment, we had to set up our Raspberry Pi and code it to make the Pi print "Hello World!" ten times- code found [here](https://github.com/lcrosby13/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Scripts/LED_Blink.sh).

### Lessons Learned
During this assignment, we learned some basics in Bash and how the Pi terminal works, as well as how to set up the Pi and attach it to the monitor. 

## Hello Python (Dice Roller)
### Objectives
The objective of this assignment was to make a little program that, when the user presses enter, displays a random number between 1 and 6, like a dice roll. Code found [here](https://github.com/lcrosby13/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/DiceRoller.py).

### Lessons Learned
From this assignment, we learned some basics of how Python works, because in previous years we'd coded in C, and if you've taken AP Computer Science (like me), then you learn Java, so Python is new.
